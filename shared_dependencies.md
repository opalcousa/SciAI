Shared Dependencies:

1. Database Schema: The MongoDB database schema will be shared across all Django models and views. This includes the schemas for raw materials, formulations, and projects.

2. Exported Variables: The Django views will export variables to the templates, which will be used by the React components. These include the raw materials, formulations, and projects data.

3. DOM Element IDs: The React components will use DOM element IDs to manipulate the HTML elements. These include IDs for the raw materials form, formulations form, projects form, and the chat widget.

4. Message Names: The Django views and React components will use message names to communicate with each other. These include messages for CRUD operations on raw materials, formulations, and projects, as well as messages for the AI assistant.

5. Function Names: The Django views and React components will share function names for CRUD operations on raw materials, formulations, and projects, as well as functions for the AI assistant, unit conversion, and cost calculation.

6. Libraries: Django, React, MongoDB, Djongo, pint, pandas, numpy, and OpenAI's GPT-4 API are the shared libraries across the application.

7. Modules: The unit conversion module, formulation management module, cost calculation module, and AI assistant module are shared across the application.
